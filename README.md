# K-D Tree - Solution for Circuit Data

Create a solution to semi-automate the Circuit runs between strobe ckt to create an optimal loss of voltage with the use of K-D Tree as the algorthim.

<h2> Problem </h2> 
<p>Given a set of <b>STROBES</b> (devices used in fire alarm systems to visual notify occupants in the case of a fire) with a <b>X,Y,Z</b> coordinate.</p>


We need to find the most optimal circute run in which will have the lowest voltage drop.
Then use the cicuit in a CAD drawing to create a techincal drawing that can be followed in the field.
The Starting location is to be an inital node point that is the locaiton of the fire alarm panel.

The Circuit run will follow from the Panel (FACP/NAC) to the closest Strobe(Device) then follow it to the next closest Device until all devices have been addresssed to follow a circuit run.</div>
